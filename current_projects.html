		<h3>Kitchen Chaos (Single Player)</h3>
		<p>
			Description:	I followed a beginner/intermediate tutorial, https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg , to create Kitchen Chaos! <br>
					Interesting project. I had gotten about a hour done, had a half-year "brick wall" of a mental block while still wanting to complete it, <br>
					then in late October I managed to consistently start work until it was completed!<br>
					It has a main menu, ability to exit the game, an intermediate loading screen into the game,<br>
					pause screen, (work on later)<br>
					(work on later)<br>

		<h2> University Coursework</h2>
		
		<h3>Golf Game</h3>
		<p>
			Description:	A lightweight golf game. Uses Unity's physics, Cinemachine for the camera, and prefabs to build golf courses much easier<br>
					Has a main menu to select levels, UI to show number of hits and par for the course, and it (somewhat) supports mobile<br>
					Mobile controls need polish (selecting the power of the stroke) and mobile sensitivity of the camera needs severly toned down<br>
					I would have also liked to add a power bar indicator! Overall, given the time constraints, I made a decent minimal viable product and learned a lot<br>
			Date:		(date game was created, 2021?)<br>

			Description:	A simple racing game I made for a University project. Features Unity's old input system to control/steer the car via WSAD,<br>
					a figure-8 track, and triggers to keep track of if the player's car completed a lap<br>
					Uses Unity's physics engine and a simple force behind the car to make the car move<br>
