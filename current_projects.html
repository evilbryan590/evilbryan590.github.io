		<h2>Current Experimental Work</h2>
		
		<h3>Clicker Game</h3>
		<p>
			I'm currently working on a clicker game; Todo:<br>
			- Finish my current prototype that uses some form of an ascension mechanic and resets all leveled up values.<br>
			- Make a rough UI design for the next game. The game should take 2 weeks to a month to complete.<br>
			- Learn about math for game devs to learn different types of reletive scaling to make the game fun.<br>
			- Obtain assets for the clicker game to cause some form of reward system. Probably will use cat pictures every XYZ upgrades and make a cat clicker with a gallery of pictures.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Pong</h3>
		<p>
			I'd like to try to add extremely simple AI to this project:<br>
			Make the enemy paddle just move towards where the ball's current up/down location is always,<br>
			and the ball continuiously gets faster every time it hits a wall.
