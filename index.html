		### Current Experimental Work
		Clicker Game  

		I'm currently working on a clicker game; Todo:
		- Finish my current prototype that uses some form of an ascension mechanic and resets all leveled up values.
		- Make a rough UI design for the next game. The game should take 2 weeks to a month to complete.
		- Learn about math for game devs to learn different types of reletive scaling to make the game fun. 
		- Obtain assets for the clicker game to cause some form of reward system. Probably will use cat pictures every XYZ upgrades and make a cat clicker with a gallery of pictures.

		Pong
		I'd like to try to add extremely simple AI to this project:  
		Make the enemy paddle just move towards where the ball's current up/down location is always,  
		and the ball continuiously gets faster every time it hits a wall.
